The Art Gallery How-to also known as Paint Diary

The pupose of this project was to work with a team and create an application that allows users to
learn more about different art mediums. My team and I were able to connect 12 components that give
access to information from grahite to oil paints. The comments portion of the components present the 
users a platform to discuss, share and ask questions.

Uilization:
Javascript,
HTML5,
CSS,
MongoDB,
Express,
React

This project was ran from the MERN stack. The software used was Express, MongoDB, React, and Javascript.

    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    "react-router-dom": "^6.13.0"
  - "bcrypt": "^5.1.0",

    "mongoose": "^7.3.1",
    "npm": "^9.7.2",
    "validator": "^13.9.0"
Some features that my team and I decided would be useful were:
  -comments section
  -youtube embeds for how-to-videos
  -images to refere to when deciding what your niche may be
  -step-by-step instructions
  -information on what can be bought fro strter kits

Launch and installation:
using vs-code
*Create a new folder using mkdir
*copy the public repository
*to download node.js "npm init-y"
*copy the code from the repository
*Once you have a project started you'll install the following
  * npm install
              -express
              -cors
              -mongoose
              -react-router-dom
              -axios
Once everything in installed you'll be able to make changes to the repository and make this
beautiful webpage your own.

The project status is complete although I will be adding more to this application in the future including:
* links to starter kits
* authorization and authentication for individual users

This project was inspired by my love and passion for paiting and creating.
A huge thanks to my team for making this dream a possibility for me.
